The compiling instructions of source code::

1. The train and test files has to be in the same folder as the source code folder.
2. The main file is singlelayerperceptron.java 
3. From the command prompt set the path to the current folder where source code is present and complie the code using the command 
	
	javac singlelayerperceptron.java
4. This will generate the class files in the same folder.
5. Execute the code by running the command 
	
	java singlelayerperceptron
6. The console will print "enter fields in the order each separated by a space 1.training file 2.test file 3.learning rate 4.the number of iterations"
7. Type the train file name, test file name, learning rate , number of iterations in the following format(all fields have a space between them)

	train.dat.txt test.dat.txt 0.01 2000(after entering 4 field values press enter .. the code will run and output successfully)
	
8. The output is the accuracy with both test and train data.

9. The platform used while developing the code is windows8.
